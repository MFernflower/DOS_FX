A bunch of assembler programs that produce graphical fx in MSDOS

Inspired by various MSDOS malwares and prank programs of the mid 1980's to early 1990's

All of the programs outside the prank folder are completely benign - the ones in the prank folder hang MSDOS in a way that you will need to power-cycle to return to normal - for the love of all that is retro please do not use those programs on machines with vintage mechanical hard drives as those do not enjoy random power-cycling! 

You will need FASM to build them

They work fine in dosbox if you do not have a acutal MSDOS machine
